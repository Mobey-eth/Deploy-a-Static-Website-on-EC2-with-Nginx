        <h2>About EC2</h2>
        <p>
          Amazon Web Service EC2 is a web service which is provided by the AWS
          cloud which is secure, resizable, and scalable. These virtual machines
          are pre-configured with the operating systems and some of the required
          software. Instead of managing the infrastructure AWS will do that so
          you can just launch and terminate the EC2 instance whenever you want.
          You can scale up and down the EC2 instance depending on the incoming
          traffic. The other advantage of AWS EC2 is that you need to pay only
          for how much you use it is like the pay-as-you-go model.
